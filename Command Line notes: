BASH/Shell.

Kernel is the program that interfaces with the hardware and is basically the core of your OS,
vs the Shell, which is the user interface. 

examples:
GUI (Graphical user interface)
- So, when you open up windows explorer/Mac finder, this is using a GUI to display everything.

CLI (Command Line Interface):
- Using Bash (Bourne Again SHell) instead within UNIX.

Command Line gives greater control than the GUI. 

Command Line techniques and directory navigation:
List Files and Directories (ls):
- ls (this will list everything in the current directory when typed on its own)
- ls CSSFlag (this will list everything in the CSSFlag folder that we have [cssflag.html flagstyle.css])

Change Directory (cd): 
- cd Dicee (as an example, will change directories into the Dicee folder). 
- cd ../ (Will take us back up to the root, going up a level)
- You can drill further down so like, cd Dicee/NextOneDown, but if there are many layers, this can get very long and cumbersome.
- cd ~ will take you back up into the root on Windows/Linux/Mac, so in this case with gitpod, it's actually up further than /workspace

- Neat trick: Hold down alt to be able to click on command line to edit it (Useful for if you've made a typo in your bash commands)
- Ctrl + a will put you at the front, Ctrl + E will put you at the end.
- Ctrl + U clears the whole line.

Creating, Opening and Removing files and directories through the command line:
- Using touch, open, start and rm.
- mkdir folderName (making directory/folder, you can use 'cd FileName' to change into it)
- touch fileName (making a file)
- open fileName (open the file from the CLI with Mac), start FileName(open file from CLI on Windows)
- This can also be used to open a file with a specific application on a Desktop, you just need a flag:
  - For Mac: 'open -a /Applications/AppName .app FileName
  - For Windows, open a file whilst in VSCode: code Filename  

- Deleting files:
 - rm - By itself will remove the file you're currently in.
 - To be specific: rm fileName
- Removing multiples:
  - cd into the directory you want to remove them from (to check which directory you're in, use 'pwd' [Print working directory])
  - rm * (the star means 'all').

Deleting Directories:
- rm -r directoryName/ (This will remove the directory and ALL of the files and folders within it.)
- rf flag is like a git Force. Be very very careful when using this.

The cons of this method are that you don't have the GUI to protect you. There are some prompts to mitigate this, but not with everything.
Just remember to always check where you are before performing any destructive commands.
